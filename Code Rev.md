# Code Review

    In software Engineering, one of the most important task is to assure the quality of the code. Software engineering teams that are based on agile model highly depends on code review to ensure the software quality since the work in agile teams is generally decentralized accross the team members. It is highly possible in software engineering teams that other team members also know the specifics of different part of code other than the one they are working on. As per the article published in Atlassian, every team member of the agile team works on the specific feature of the whole product.  The programmers introduce new features, modify the code of the existing features or remove any problem or errors from the existing code. 

##  So what happens in Code Review?

        A software developer works on a particular feature or part of the whole software code and submits the code he/she worked on to be reviewed by other developers working on other parts of the code. The devlopers while reviewing the code look for logical errors in the code, determine whether the requirements are met or not, check the automated test cases for the code and see whether they will be enough to test the authenticity of the code. 

 ##   Benefits of Code Review

1. Knowledge Sharing:-
        One of the most important benefit of the code review is the knowledge sharing. Anyone in the team can take any task from the backlog as no one is made specific to particular code. For example, full stack developers can plan to work front end for some sprints while server side for some. 
    
2. Estimation:-
        It is highly important to estimate the completion time for the product. Since the knowledge related to the product is equally shared among the team members, they are able to make better judgments. There is also a high chance that the code reviewers are introduced to code complexity, issues related to that particular part of the code. 

3. New engineers:-
        Code Reviews helps the team to welcome new engineers as the experienced engineers already working on the project get a chance to mentor new batch of engineers. It helps in establishing the conversation between the engineers regarding the code. It also benefits the team as new engineers may give a completly new perspective or ideas to the part of the code which may be beneficial. 

4. Load Sharing:-
        Every part of the main code which the developer has worked on is reviewed by atleast 2 engineers from the team before it is merged with the main code. The software developer selects other engineers from the team and 2 of them selected can review the code. This way it decentralizes the work and avoids any bottleneck. Any engineer with the knowledge and time can review the code and provide any insights that can benefit the code which may be taken into consideration by the developer of the code.

5. Identifying the errors:
        Code review helps in rectifying the errors or confusions that the software developer may have made while building the code. The problems can be related to the architecture the application, compilation errors, typos, requirements etc.. These problems can be avoided before the code is merged in the main application code. The code review will help in maintaining the authenticity and proper functioning of the applications.

## When to plan code review?

    Planning the time of code reviews is specific to each team. Some software engineers such as Buchino suggest that code reviews should be done in the initial stages or just after the design review so that all the team members can share the knowledge of the code. This way uniformity at the base level of code can be achieved and will encourage the team members to follow the similar coding practices while writing the code. While some engineers like QLogitek's Lalande suggests that code reviews can be done just when the developers feels confident and their code has successfully passed the automated unit test. 

## How to do Code Review?
    
    There are certain factors that need to be considered while reviewing the code so as to make it effective. Some factors are listed as below:-

1. Code Review should be done in fixed time slots and one should not try to review the whole code at once.
2. Several tools can be used to collaboratively review the code with other team members which increase the quality and simultaneously reduces the time taken in code review.
3. Appropriate metrics should be defined before starting the code review. The metrics can be "reducing the defects" not simply "rbug reduction" which doesn't imply much.
4. Criticism should be taken in a positive way given by the code reviewers and developers should try to learn and find this as a new opportunity to gain knowledge and identify any sort of weakness.
   
5. The process to fix bugs should be well defined and discuss in detail with the developer after the code review is done. All the changes made to the code should be verified before merging the code into the main application code.
