                                Code Review

                                In software Engineering, one of the most important task is to assure the quality of the code. Software engineering teams that are based on agile model highly depends on code review to ensure the software quality since the work in agile teams is generally decentralized accross the team members. It is highly possible in software engineering teams that other team members also know the specifics of different part of code other than the one they are working on. As per the article published in Atlassian, every team member of the agile team works on the specific feature of the whole product.  The programmers introduce new features, modify the code of the existing features or remove any problem or errors from the existing code. 

    So what happens in Code Review?

        A software developer works on a particular feature or part of the whole software code and submits the code he/she worked on to be reviewed by other developers working on other parts of the code. The devlopers while reviewing the code look for logical errors in the code, determine whether the requirements are met or not, check the automated test cases for the code and see whether they will be enough to test the authenticity of the code. 

    Benefits of Code Review

    Knowledge Sharing:-
        One of the most important benefit of the code review is the knowledge sharing. Anyone in the team can take any task from the backlog as no one is made specific to particular code. For example, full stack developers can plan to work front end for some sprints while server side for some.
