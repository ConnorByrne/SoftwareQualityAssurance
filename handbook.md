# Task Estimation

## What is it?
Task esimation is the process in which software engineers and project managers will evaluate the scope of an upcoming project in order to accurately predict the amount of effort and resources that will be needed to complete the project.

Resources, in this situation, refers to the amount of time the project will take, how many specialist need to be involved, and the money that the project will cost from begining to completion.

These estimations are usualy performed based on each aspect of the project indivdualy to gain an understanding of what is required by each module, and then cumulated to give a holistic view of the project as a whole.

## Why is it important?
Firstly, it is important to gain an understanding of the requirments of a project before comming oneself to it. There are many aspects of projects that will contribute to the amount of time or other resources that may not be recodnised at a cursory glance, for example:

1. interaction with other non technical teams for various needs that may slow down the progress of the project.

2. the need for software engineers to upskill in a certain area or even gain an understanding of an entirely new technology for the system to function correctly.

3. The likley hood of unforseen problems in development, such as unexpected bugs, or other barricades preventing the project from continuing at a steady pace. This ties closley into the nedd for engineers

4. The possibility of scope creep, or in other words, the likleyhood that stake holders of the project are going to want to include vital functionailty to development after the project is underway, that was not included in the orginal project specification.

Taking all of these factors into consideration, both as a project manager as a team member, are important for coming up with realistic time frames for when the project can feasibly be delivered. 

The process of task estimation itself provides a valuable opportunity to examine the project from a high angle, and understand all its variables.

Not only can gaining this undertanding contribute to accurate projections for project completion, which can then be communicated to stake holders. But also, examining the projects by a task-by-task basis can help reduce the project time as a whole, and lead to a more streamlined process. One in which all possible obsticals have been accounted for, and even the possibilty of unforseen obsticals has been considered, allowing for a more certain, lower stress, more streamlined, and faster process altogether.
